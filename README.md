Shield Insurance is exploring ways to enhance its data-driven decision-making through a Power BI dashboard that delivers actionable insights into critical performance indicators. To assess the suitability of partnering with AtliQ Technologies, they are initiating a Pilot Project as a Proof of Concept, allowing AtliQ to showcase its ability to meet Shield Insurance’s specific requirements before moving forward with a full-scale engagement.

* **Dive deeper into sales performance** by analyzing trends in sales modes, customer distribution, and revenue share across various age groups, cities, and sales channels.
